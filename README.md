4. **Lab-04**: Project: OnlineRetailData Customer Segmentation - Clustering 
>   -  K-Means Clustering : Segmenting the customers based 3 dimensions (Frequency, Amount, and Recency) behavior.
>   - Implementation of `Elbow` and `Silhouette` method for finding optimal `K-Value`
>   - Implementing of Density based Clustering algorithm- `DBSCAN`
>   - Model Evaluation using `silhouette` scores

5. **Lab-05**: Project: WineDataset- Principal Component Analysis - Clustering
    
> - Performing `PCA` for dimensionality reduction.
> - finding the correct number of principal component using the `scree plot` and the `cumulative variance`.
> -  K-Means Clustering : Segmenting the customers based 3 dimensions (Frequency, Amount, and Recency) behavior.
>   - Implementation of Elbow and Silhouette method for finding optimal `K-Value`
>  - Visualizing the clusters.


6. **Lab-06**: project:RainFall Prediction using `Multilayer Perceptrion`
